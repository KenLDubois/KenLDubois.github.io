This is an Ecommerce site that I was commissioned to develop for a local business in Niagara-on-the-Lake. This site had several important requirements, which included:
- Attractively display the company’s hundreds of products and dozens of catalogues
- Track and receive online orders
- Host the company’s emails
- Provide a way for customers to contact the company online and sign up for their newsletter

### My Role
This was a commissioned project that I worked on independently. Besides design, development and deployment tasks, I was also responsible for pitching and coordinating with the client directly. This meant developing the project’s scope, adhering to tight deadlines and budgets and teaching the client how to use the backend system.
