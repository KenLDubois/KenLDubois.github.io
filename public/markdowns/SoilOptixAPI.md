SoilOptix is a company that develops detailed soil nutrient and texture maps using proprietary sensor technology. The API we produced for them provides their partners and clients a secure, flexible way to access their data and build bespoke GUIs, visualizations and other products to fit their needs.

### My Role

Although several people worked on the SoilOptix database and its associated web app, I was the primary developer on the API itself. My tasks included:

- Developing complex queries and returning data to the end user in a logically structured way
- Securing the API using JavaScript Web Tokens and Entity Framework
- Producing documentation for end users of the API
- Producing documentation for future developers of the API
- Implementing a Swagger UI for the API endpoints using Swashbuckle
