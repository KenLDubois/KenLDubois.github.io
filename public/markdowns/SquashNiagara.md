This application was developed as a community sponsored during my fourth semester at Niagara College. Several groups competed to produce an application for a local squash league (Squash Niagara) that would be used to securely:
- Upload and display game schedules
- Track game scores, team rank and player standings
- Create and edit team and player information. Of all the groups competing, our project was selected by the client and is currently in the process of being deployed as their primary web site. A detailed overview of the important features and workflows for this web app can be found on YouTube [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oZhePog1_g "Squash Niagara demo on YouTube"):

### My Role
I was one of five contributors to this project. While I contributed to nearly every aspect of this project (including data modeling, frontend design and authentication) my primary responsibilities were:
- Creating the ‘Teams’ section where captains and admins could edit a team’s roster and details. This is also where players could view each team’s standing in the league including wins, losses and points accumulated over the season
- Creating a league directory that allowed players to search for information on players, teams and fixtures using a variety of search terms and filters
- The primary navigation that was used across the site
- Seeding data to demonstrate the site’s functionality to the client
