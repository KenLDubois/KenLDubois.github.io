This project takes data from proprietary sensors developed by SoilOptix and performs complex regressions to produce highly detailed maps of the nutrient composition of farmer’s fields. The web portal provides secure access for administrators and customers to store, manipulate and download visualizations of this data.

### My Role
I was one of several contributors to this project as part of my employment at Niagara College’s Research and Innovation Center. My main contribution was redeveloping the controllers used to filter and export reports and visualizations. I also helped to revise the structure of the database, the authentication system and performed numerous bug fixes.

### Interesting Project Features
Because SoilOptix processes thousands of acres weekly, and the resolution of the soil maps gets as high as 3.5 meters, the amount of data accumulated by this system is enormous. This means that we needed to careful to optimise our data queries and manipulation to optimise speed without sacrificing its integrity or security.
